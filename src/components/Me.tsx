      <h2 class="blue">Description</h2>
      <p>I'm third year Computer Engineering student at CESI in France.</p>
      <p>
        I am mostly interested in distributed systems, as well as performance
        and scalability.
      </p>
      <p>
        I most enjoy learning, and strive to be better in all aspects of my
        life, as well as in my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I strive for simplicity in all aspects, and regard myself as a
        minimalist.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blue">School</h2>
      <p>
        School wants us to paste some board here, saying how we want to improve
        and stuff, but I'm not huge on predicting the future, neither do I find
        the exercice entertaining.
